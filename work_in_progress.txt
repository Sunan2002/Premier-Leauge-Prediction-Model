Main problem to solve:
We are going to attempt to predict the outcome of future English Premier League soccer games in the 
2022-2023 season based on data from the 2021-2022, as well as previous matches from the 2022-2023 season.

Description of dataset, and how you will you obtain it:
Datasets for EPL 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seaons downloaded from the web, with in depth stats for every game
played, from which we will choose and analyze different combinations of features for our prediction models.

Hypothesis:
The outcome of unplayed Engish Premier League matches can be predicted with an accuracy of greater than 50%
using data from earlier in the season, as well as data from the prior season.

Data Mining and/or Machine Learning methods you plan to use (and why) What business applications do you think your findings will have?
Our algorithm, if successful, could be used to calculate Vegas odds for sports betting, and it could also be used to value teams/players
based on past performances.
