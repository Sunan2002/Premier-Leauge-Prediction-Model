Main problem to solve:
We are going to attempt to predict the outcome of future English Premier League soccer games in the 
2022-2023 season based on data from the 2021-2022, as well as previous matches from the 2022-2023 season.

Description of dataset, and how you will you obtain it:
Datasets for EPL 2021-2022 and 2022-2023 seaons were downloaded from the web int he form of .csv files, with in depth stats for every game
played, from which we will choose and analyze different combinations of features for our prediction models.

Hypothesis:
The winner of unplayed Engish Premier League matches can be predicted with an accuracy of greater than 50%
using data from earlier in the season, as well as data from the prior season. If we achieve this fairly easily, we will attempt to predict 
accurate Vegas odds for unplayed matches rather than merely the winner.

Data Mining and/or Machine Learning methods you plan to use (and why) What business applications do you think your findings will have?
We are using XGBoost for preprocessing, and we plan to use simple logistic regression, as well as a neural network. Both models will be trained on
the prior season, and we will decide how to go about using the existing data from the current season for either training, validation, or testing in 
a way that makes the most sense. Our algorithm, if successful, could be used to calculate Vegas odds for sports betting companies, and it could also 
be modified to help value teams/players based on past performances when trying to determine one's value for tranfer fees.
